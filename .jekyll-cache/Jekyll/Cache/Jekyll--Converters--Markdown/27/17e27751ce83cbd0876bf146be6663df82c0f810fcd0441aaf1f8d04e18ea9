<p>My research interests span social psychology, political science, and cognitive neuroscience. Broadly, Iâ€™m interested in exploring the neural correlates of political partisansip, as well as designing interventions to reduce polarization.

I employ a variety of computation methods to explore these subjects, ranging from linear and logistic modeling to more nuanced, Machine Learning approaches (e.g., clustering and decomposition). The bulk of my analyses are conducted in Python and R, and I have used MySQL and MariaDB for various projects as well.
