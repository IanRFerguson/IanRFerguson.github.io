                        <p>
                              I am a social scientist at Stanford University, where I work as the Lab Manager for the

                              under the direction of Dr. Jamil Zaki. Principally, I am interested in taking data-driven approaches to exploring the
                              relationship between hierarchical status threat and use of hate speech on social media. Other projects I am actively
                              involved in include modeling neural responses to simulated social support as a buffering mechanism to negative affect,
                              as well as quantifying moral language usage in the US congress as a predictor of party voting behavior.

                              compiling voter information and scripting text and email blasts. I'm passionate about using data and technology to make
                              the world a more equitable place!

                                    Taking an experimental approach, I measured the cognitive effects of status threat
                                    in non-Hispanic white individuals. After a threat prime, participants rated ensembles
                                    of mixed-race groups on several dimensions. A GEE model offered evidence for a linear trend,
                                    such that as the number of Hispanic social targets increased the group was rated as more threatening.

                                    stems were assessed for AFINN polarity values.
