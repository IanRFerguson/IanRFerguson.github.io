I am currently a full-time researcher and administrator in the <a href="http://ssnl.stanford.edu/" target=_blank><b>Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab</b></a>.
<br><br>
My research interests span social psychology, political science, and cognitive neuroscience. Broadly, I'm interested in exploring the neural correlates of political partisansip, as well as designing interventions to reduce polarization.
<br> <br>
For a primer on my interests, read my Master's thesis <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L7G3iU2ldK4k4XYQ6jvOPC88zT1LMdg6/view?usp=sharing" target=_blank>here</a>.
<br> <br>
I employ a variety of computational methods to explore these subjects, ranging from conventional linear and logistic regression to more nuanced, Machine Learning approaches (e.g., regularization, clustering, and decomposition).

## Tracking Polarization
----------------
Among my principal interests is assessing the degree to which political polarization influences our interactions with members of the opposite party. Analyzing the *downstream effects* of polarization and their covariates has certainly never been more relevant to our understanding of intergroup relations.

<br>
By leveraging social psychological theoretical frameworks and contemporary algorithmic approaches (e.g., Natural Language Processing and PCA) together, my aim is to shine a light on the antecedents of polarization in order to structure policy syntax in a minimally polarizing way.
