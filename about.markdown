I am currently a full-time researcher and administrator in the <a href="http://ssnl.stanford.edu/" target=_blank><b>Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab</b></a>.
<br><br>
My research interests span social psychology, political science, and cognitive neuroscience. Broadly, I'm interested in exploring the neural and attitudinal correlates of political partisansip, as well as designing interventions to reduce polarization.
<br> <br>
Among my principal interests is assessing the degree to which political polarization influences our interactions with members of the opposite party. Analyzing the *downstream effects* of polarization and their covariates has certainly never been more relevant to our understanding of intergroup relations. For a primer on my research, see my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L7G3iU2ldK4k4XYQ6jvOPC88zT1LMdg6/view?usp=sharing" target=_blank><b>Master's thesis</b></a>.
