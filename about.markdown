# Research
-------------
I am currently a full-time researcher and administrator in the <a href="http://ssnl.stanford.edu/" target=_blank><b>Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab</b></a>.
<br><br>
My research interests span social psychology, political science, and cognitive neuroscience. Broadly, I'm interested in exploring the neural correlates of political partisansip, as well as designing interventions to reduce polarization.
<br> <br>
I employ a variety of computational methods to explore these subjects, ranging from conventional linear and logistic regression to more nuanced, Machine Learning approaches (e.g., regularization, clustering, and decomposition).

# Outside of Academia
---------------------
In addition to my academic research, I play drums in the Richmond, VA based rock band The Concussion Theory and enjoy analog street photography.
